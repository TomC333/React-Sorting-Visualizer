# Sorting Visualizer âœ¨

## Background ðŸ¤¯

At the beginning, I watched [this video](https://youtu.be/pFXYym4Wbkc?list=PL3lfepputJuGAaI3S7FvcBIutzHNtZ_pb), and at the same time, my friend needed help with React Native. Since I didnâ€™t knew React Native, and I wanted to create a project, I decided to create a sorting visualizer to learn React Native and, of course, to create some repos on GitHub. ðŸ˜„

Even though the project was functional, the code was terrible! ðŸ˜… Most things were hardcoded, some buttons werenâ€™t even working properly, and the app wasnâ€™t responsive at all. So, in 2025, I decided to rewrite it using vanilla TypeScript. I wanted to make it more fancy, create some generic classes, write test cases, and throw in all the extra stuff. ðŸ˜†

At the end of the day, the project is better from a functionality perspective: all the buttons are working, sorting animations are smoother, and the webpage is responsive. It's still not perfect, but itâ€™s definitely better than before! ðŸ˜…

But code looks like a shit again ðŸ’©

## Setup ðŸŒ±

The setup is as simple as it gets!

1. If you haven't already, download and install Node.js and npm from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Open your terminal/command prompt and Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you cloned the Sorting Visualizer repository.
3. Open a terminal and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
4. After that, simply run `npm run dev` for a local development environment.
